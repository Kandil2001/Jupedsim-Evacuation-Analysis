## Overview

This project provides a robust and highly optimized framework for **pedestrian evacuation analysis** using the **JuPedSim** library. It leverages advanced techniquesâ€”parallel agent distribution, Numba-accelerated computations, smart caching, and efficient geometry handlingâ€”to simulate building evacuations in realistic scenarios. Designed for scalability, clarity, and speed, it is suitable for both research and practical safety analysis.

## Theoretical Background

Pedestrian dynamics is the study of how individuals and crowds move through space. It blends physics, behavioral psychology, and computational modeling to simulate realistic movementâ€”especially in evacuation scenarios.

### ðŸ”¹ Social Force Model

This foundational model treats pedestrians as particles influenced by virtual forces:

- **Attractive forces** pull individuals toward goals (e.g., exits).
- **Repulsive forces** push them away from obstacles and other people.
- The combination of these forces governs movement patterns.

In this diagram:
- Arrows represent directional forces acting on a pedestrian.
- The person adjusts their path based on nearby agents, walls, and their destination.

### ðŸ”¹ Bottleneck Behavior

When many agents attempt to pass through a narrow exit, congestion forms. This is known as **bottleneck behavior**, and itâ€™s critical in evacuation planning.

This image shows participants in a controlled evacuation experiment. Notice how density increases near the bottleneck, slowing overall flow.

### ðŸ”¹ Pedestrian Flow Heatmaps

Heatmaps visualize crowd density and movement intensity across a space. Theyâ€™re used to identify high-traffic zones and optimize layouts.

In this example:
- Red zones indicate high pedestrian density.
- Blue zones show low activity.
- Architects and safety engineers use these maps to redesign space for smoother flow.

### ðŸ”¹ Microscopic vs. Macroscopic Models

- **Microscopic models** simulate each pedestrian individually, capturing detailed interactions.
- **Macroscopic models** treat crowds as continuous flows, similar to fluidsâ€”useful for large-scale analysis.

---

JuPedSim supports these modeling approaches and allows researchers to define building layouts, spawn zones, and exit strategies using XML and WKT formats. Itâ€™s widely used in safety engineering, urban planning, and evacuation research.

## Real-World Applications

- **Architecture**: Optimize exit placements and corridor widths  
- **Event Planning**: Ensure safe crowd dispersal in stadiums and venues  
- **Transportation Hubs**: Manage congestion in airports and stations  
- **Urban Design**: Analyze pedestrian flow in public spaces

---

## Ethical Considerations

- **Privacy**: Real-world data must be anonymized  
- **Inclusivity**: Account for diverse mobility needs  
- **Transparency**: Document assumptions and limitations

---

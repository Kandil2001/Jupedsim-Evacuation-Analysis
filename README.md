## Overview

This project provides a robust and highly optimized framework for **pedestrian evacuation analysis** using the **JuPedSim** library. It leverages advanced techniques‚Äîparallel agent distribution, Numba-accelerated computations, smart caching, and efficient visualization‚Äîto simulate building evacuations in realistic scenarios. Designed for scalability, clarity, and speed, it is suitable for both research and practical safety analysis.

---

## Features

- üöÄ **Parallel Agent Distribution**: Agents are distributed across spawn areas using `ThreadPoolExecutor` for fast, multi-core setup.
- üí® **Numba-Accelerated Calculations**: Critical functions (e.g., nearest exit lookup) are compiled to machine code using Numba for speed.
- üß† **Smart Caching**: Building geometry is loaded with `lru_cache`, minimizing disk I/O.
- üìä **Efficient Data Handling**: NumPy vectorized operations accelerate distance calculations and geometry manipulations.
- üñºÔ∏è **Optimized Visualization**: Fast plotting with NumPy and Matplotlib for both setup and evacuation animation.
- üìù **Progress Reporting**: Live simulation progress updates for long runs.
- üèÉ **Batch Agent Addition**: Agents are added per spawn area batch for scalable performance.
- üîÑ **Scenario Flexibility**: Easily configure spawn/exit assignments, motivation factors, and speed distributions.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kandil2001/Jupedsim-Evacuation-Analysis.git
    cd Jupedsim-Evacuation-Analysis
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Or install individually if needed:
    pip install jupedsim pedpy shapely numpy matplotlib numba
    ```

3. **Run the simulation**
    - Open the `Ped1 - Copy.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
    - Run all cells to execute the evacuation simulation from setup to animation.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook

### Dependencies

Install required libraries with pip:

```bash
pip install jupedsim pedpy shapely numpy matplotlib numba
```

If you use conda/miniconda, you may prefer:

```bash
conda install numpy matplotlib shapely
pip install jupedsim pedpy numba
```

---

## Usage

### Running in Jupyter

- Open `Ped1 - Copy.ipynb` in Jupyter.
- Each cell is documented and walks through:
    - Importing libraries
    - Loading building geometry (`HC.wkt`)
    - Defining exits and spawn areas
    - Parallel agent distribution and exit assignment
    - Batch agent addition and scenario configuration
    - Visualization of setup and evacuation
    - Simulation loop and progress reporting
    - Animation and summary results

### Custom Scenario Configuration

Change the scenarios in the notebook to adjust:
- **active_spawns:** Which spawn areas are active
- **exit_assignments:** Manual assignment of exits to spawn areas
- **T_motivation:** Motivation factor for agent movement
- **speed_mean / speed_std:** Walking speed statistics

---

## Configuration

### Scenario Parameters

Each scenario can be configured with:
- `active_spawns`: List of booleans indicating which spawn areas to use
- `exit_assignments`: List (per spawn) of exit indices or custom exit assignments
- `T_motivation`: Motivation factor for movement
- `speed_mean`: Mean walking speed (m/s)
- `speed_std`: Standard deviation of walking speed

### Building Geometry

- Geometry is loaded from WKT file (`HC.wkt`)
- Exits and spawn areas are shaped as polygons, and agent distributions are controlled per area

---

## Performance Benchmarks

- Agent distribution and exit assignment are parallelized‚Äîsetup is fast even for hundreds/thousands of agents.
- Numba-accelerated functions (e.g., nearest exit lookup) are orders of magnitude faster than pure Python.
- Smart caching and batch operations minimize memory footprint and maximize speed.

---

## Visualization

- Initial configuration plot: Shows walkable area, exits, spawns, and agent positions.
- Animated evacuation: Simulation trajectory is read from SQLite and animated with live progress reporting.

## FAQ

**Q:** How do I add new exits or spawn areas?
**A:** Edit the respective polygons in the notebook cells and update the scenario configuration.

**Q:** Can I use different algorithms for agent distribution?
**A:** Yes, replace the distribution function or update parameters as needed.

**Q:** How can I export results for further analysis?
**A:** Trajectories are saved to SQLite files; use pandas or custom scripts to extract metrics.

**Q:** How to handle large simulations?
**A:** The framework is optimized for scalability. Increase batch sizes or parallelism if needed, and monitor memory usage.

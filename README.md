## Overview

This project provides a robust and highly optimized framework for **pedestrian evacuation analysis** using the **Jupedsim** library. By leveraging advanced performance techniques like **parallel processing** with `ThreadPoolExecutor`, **Numba acceleration**, and **vectorized operations**, the simulation can efficiently model complex evacuation scenarios involving thousands of agents. The codebase is designed for both researchers and practitioners who need to analyze human behavior in emergency situations without being limited by computational constraints.

## Features

This project includes several key optimizations to ensure high-performance simulation:

* üöÄ **Parallel Agent Distribution**: Utilizes `ThreadPoolExecutor` to distribute agent spawning across multiple CPU cores, dramatically reducing setup time for large-scale simulations.
* üí® **Numba-Accelerated Calculations**: Compiles critical functions, such as finding the nearest exit, to machine code using **Numba**, resulting in significant speed improvements.
* üß† **Smart Caching**: Implements an `lru_cache` for geometry files, ensuring the building layout is loaded from disk only once, even if called multiple times.
* üìä **Efficient Data Handling**: Uses **vectorized NumPy operations** for fast, memory-efficient distance calculations and geometric manipulations.
* üñºÔ∏è **Optimized Visualization**: Includes a streamlined plotting function that uses NumPy arrays to reduce rendering overhead and efficiently visualize the simulation setup.
* üìù **Progress Reporting**: Provides real-time updates on simulation progress, which is particularly useful for long-running scenarios.
* üèÉ **Batch Agent Addition**: Agents are added in batches per spawn area to enhance the efficiency of the simulation setup.

## Quick Start

Get started with the simulation in just a few steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Kandil2001/Jupedsim-Evacuation-Analysis.git](https://github.com/Kandil2001/Jupedsim-Evacuation-Analysis.git)
    cd Jupedsim-Evacuation-Analysis
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the simulation:**
    Open the `Ped1 ` Jupyter Notebook.
4.  **Execute all cells** to see the evacuation simulation in action, from setup to final animation.
